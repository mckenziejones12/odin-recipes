# odin-recipes

This is my first project assigned by The Odin Project. This assignment's goal is to create a webpage with different links to recipes. By the end of this project, I wish to be more competent and efficient in using HTML elements properly, as well as becoming more comfortable commiting to my GitHub repository using the terminal.
